Adam Lindberg evaluated the vulnerabilities in thermostat devices and recently completed his master's thesis at KTH while participating in the vulnerability research program at the NSE Hacking Lab. This led to the discovery of several security issues. These include CVE-2023-42143, which involves tampered firmware updates via Man-in-the-Middle attacks; CVE-2023-46892, which allows unauthorized function execution by replaying radio signals; CVE-2023-46889, decryption of protected Wi-Fi router passwords; and CVE-2023-42144, Wi-Fi router credentials sniffing during device setup.
