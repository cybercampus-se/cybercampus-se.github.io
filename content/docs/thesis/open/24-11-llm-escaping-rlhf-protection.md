# LLM Escaping RLHF Protections

- **Thesis ID:** 24-11
- **Research Proposal:** Escaping Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Protections in Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, often enhanced by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), have become integral tools in natural language processing. RLHF aims to improve the safety and quality of LLM outputs by aligning them with human values and reducing harmful behaviors. However, adversaries might find ways to circumvent these protections, posing significant security risks. This research aims to identify methods of escaping RLHF protections in LLMs, evaluate the impact of such breaches, and propose mitigation strategies to strengthen the resilience of these models against adversarial manipulation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, providing powerful tools for various applications. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is used to fine-tune these models, enhancing their safety and ethical behavior by aligning their outputs with human values. Despite these advancements, the complexity of LLMs makes them susceptible to sophisticated attacks aimed at bypassing RLHF protections.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

While RLHF significantly enhances the safety of LLMs, it is not foolproof. Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities to bypass RLHF protections, leading to harmful or unethical outputs. This research seeks to explore the methods by which RLHF protections can be circumvented, assess the potential impacts, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks, thereby improving the overall security and reliability of LLMs.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To identify and analyze methods of escaping RLHF protections in LLMs.
2. To evaluate the impact of these security breaches on model behavior and system integrity.
