# Hacking with LLMs

- **Thesis ID:** 24-16
- **Research Proposal:** Discovering and Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Abstract

The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, particularly in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and beyond, has opened new possibilities in various fields, including cybersecurity. These models, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, have shown potential in automating and enhancing cybersecurity processes, such as vulnerability discovery and exploitation. This research aims to explore the application of LLMs in the automated discovery and exploitation of software vulnerabilities. By leveraging the advanced pattern recognition and language generation capabilities of LLMs, this study seeks to assess the effectiveness of these models in identifying security flaws in software, generating exploit code, and potentially aiding in the creation of more secure software development practices. 

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Software vulnerabilities remain a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, leading to breaches, data loss, and financial damages. Traditional methods of vulnerability discovery often require significant manual effort, deep expertise, and extensive time. However, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new avenues for automating and enhancing this process. LLMs, trained on vast corpora of code and natural language, possess the ability to understand, analyze, and generate code snippets, making them potential tools for discovering and exploiting software vulnerabilities. This research seeks to explore the capabilities of LLMs in the context of cybersecurity, specifically focusing on their ability to identify software vulnerabilities and generate corresponding exploit code.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite the promising capabilities of LLMs, their potential application in the field of cybersecurity, particularly in vulnerability discovery and exploitation, remains underexplored. There is a need to systematically assess the effectiveness, limitations, and ethical implications of using LLMs in this domain. This research aims to fill this gap by investigating how LLMs can be utilized to discover and exploit software vulnerabilities, what types of vulnerabilities they are most effective at identifying, and the ethical considerations involved in using AI for such purposes.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To explore the ability of LLMs to analyze source code and identify potential software vulnerabilities.
2. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating exploit code for discovered vulnerabilities.
3. To assess the limitations and challenges of using LLMs for vulnerability discovery and exploitation.
4. To propose ethical guidelines and best practices for the use of LLMs in cybersecurity.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Overview of Software Vulnerabilities

An examination of the common types of software vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and race conditions. Discussion on traditional methods of vulnerability discovery and exploitation, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

### 2.2 Large Language Models and Their Capabilities

Review of the development and capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, and others. Discussion on how these models are trained, their ability to understand and generate code, and their applications in various domains, including cybersecurity.

### 2.3 Application of AI in Cybersecurity

A review of existing research on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in cybersecurity. This includes studies on the use of AI for malware detection, intrusion detection systems, and automated code analysis. The review will also cover initial studies on using LLMs for security purposes.

### 2.4 Ethical Considerations in AI-Driven Vulnerability Discovery

An exploration of the ethical implications of using AI, specifically LLMs, for vulnerability discovery and exploitation. This includes discussions on responsible disclosure, the dual-use nature of AI, and the potential risks of automating exploitation.

## 3. Research Methodology

### 3.1 Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation

1. **Dataset Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of open-source software projects, including code repositories known to contain vulnerabilities. Public vulnerability databases such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) will also be utilized.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the code data to ensure it is suitable for analysis by LLMs, including tokenization, removing irrelevant comments, and structuring the code for input into LLMs.

### 3.2 Phase 2: LLM Training and Fine-Tuning

1. **Model Selection**: Select and fine-tune existing LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Codex) on the prepared dataset to focus on code analysis and vulnerability detection.
2. **Fine-Tuning for Exploitation**: Fine-tune the model further to understand exploitation techniques, using datasets of exploit code and corresponding vulnerabilities.

### 3.3 Phase 3: Vulnerability Discovery and Exploitation

1. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Use the fine-tuned LLM to analyze the codebase and identify potential vulnerabilities. Document the types of vulnerabilities discovered and compare them with known vulnerabilities in the codebase.
2. **Exploit Generation**: For each identified vulnerability, task the LLM with generating corresponding exploit code. Evaluate the quality, effectiveness, and accuracy of the generated exploits.

### 3.4 Phase 4: Evaluation and Analysis

1. **Effectiveness Analysis**: Assess the effectiveness of the LLM in discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities. This includes measuring the true positive rate, false positive rate, and the types of vulnerabilities the model is most and least effective at identifying.
2. **Comparison with Traditional Methods**: Compare the results of the LLM-driven approach with traditional vulnerability discovery and exploitation methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and effort.
3. **Limitations and Challenges**: Identify the limitations and challenges encountered during the research, including difficulties in training the LLM, the accuracy of vulnerability detection, and the complexity of generated exploits.

### 3.5 Phase 5: Ethical Considerations and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Ethical Guidelines**: Develop ethical guidelines for the use of LLMs in vulnerability discovery and exploitation, considering responsible disclosure practices and the risks of misuse.
2. **Mitigation Strategies**: Propose strategies to mitigate the risks associated with LLM-driven vulnerability research, including safeguards against the dual-use nature of such technologies.

## 4. Expected Outcomes

1. **Insight into LLM Capabilities**: A comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the context of software vulnerability discovery and exploitation.
2. **Effective Vulnerability Discovery Techniques**: Development of techniques that leverage LLMs for more effective and efficient identification of software vulnerabilities.
3. **Ethical Framework**: A set of ethical guidelines and best practices for the responsible use of LLMs in cybersecurity research.
4. **Academic Contributions**: Publication of findings in cybersecurity journals and conferences, contributing to the growing body of knowledge on AI applications in cybersecurity.
