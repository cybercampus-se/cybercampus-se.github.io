- **Thesis ID:** 24-10
- **Research Proposal:** Identifying Malicious Models in Large Language Model (LLM) Repositories

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). Platforms like HuggingFace provide a repository for sharing and accessing a wide variety of LLMs. However, the open nature of these repositories poses significant security risks, including the distribution of malicious models. This research aims to identify and analyze malicious models within LLM repositories, focusing on HuggingFace. The study will develop methodologies for detecting malicious models, assess their impact, and propose strategies to enhance the security of LLM repositories.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have shown exceptional performance in various NLP tasks. Repositories such as HuggingFace facilitate the sharing and distribution of these models, fostering innovation and accessibility. However, the openness of these platforms also makes them vulnerable to the distribution of malicious models that can be used to compromise systems, spread misinformation, or steal sensitive data.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The proliferation of LLMs in open repositories introduces new cybersecurity challenges. Malicious actors can upload compromised models that appear legitimate but contain harmful functionalities. This research aims to address the lack of comprehensive security measures in LLM repositories by developing techniques to identify and mitigate the risks posed by malicious models.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To develop methodologies for identifying malicious LLMs in repositories such as HuggingFace.
2. To evaluate the impact of malicious models on users and systems.
3. To propose mitigation strategies and best practices for enhancing the security of LLM repositories.
4. To contribute to the broader understanding of LLM security and repository management.
