# LLM Prompt Injection

- **Thesis ID:** 24-08
- **Research Proposal:** Vulnerability Research of Large Language Models (LLMs): Focus on Prompt Injection Using the Swedish Language

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, providing advanced capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, the increasing reliance on these models introduces new cybersecurity challenges. This research aims to investigate the vulnerabilities associated with LLMs, specifically focusing on prompt injection attacks using the Swedish language. By analyzing the security weaknesses and potential exploits in LLMs, the study aims to enhance the understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and propose mitigation strategies.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models, such as GPT-3 and its successors, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text. These models are utilized in various applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated content generation. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are susceptible to various types of attacks, including prompt injection, where an attacker manipulates the input prompt to influence or control the model's output.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Prompt injection attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity and reliability of LLMs. Most research on LLM vulnerabilities has been conducted in English, leaving a gap in understanding how these attacks may manifest in other languages, such as Swedish. This research seeks to explore the susceptibility of LLMs to prompt injection attacks in the Swedish language, assess their impact, and propose effective mitigation strategies.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To investigate the susceptibility of LLMs to prompt injection attacks using the Swedish language.
2. To analyze the impact of such attacks on the model's output and overall system security.
3. To develop and test methodologies for detecting and mitigating prompt injection attacks in LLMs.
4. To contribute to the broader understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and enhance the security of these models in multilingual contexts.
