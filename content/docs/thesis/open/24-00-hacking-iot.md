## Abstract

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed industries and everyday life by enabling seamless connectivity and automation. However, the rapid adoption of these devices has outpaced the development of robust security measures, leaving IoT devices vulnerable to a wide array of cyber threats. This research aims to systematically identify and analyze vulnerabilities in IoT devices, assess their potential impacts on users and networks, and propose effective mitigation strategies. By improving the security of IoT devices, this study seeks to safeguard against the growing threat landscape and contribute to the overall security of connected environments.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data autonomously. These devices range from simple sensors to complex systems in critical infrastructure, homes, and industries. While IoT devices have brought significant benefits, their widespread deployment has introduced new cybersecurity challenges. Many IoT devices are designed with limited processing power and memory, making it difficult to implement traditional security measures. Additionally, the diversity of IoT devices and lack of standardized security protocols further exacerbate the risk of vulnerabilities.
