# Application Forensics

- **Thesis ID:** 24-05
- **Research Proposal:** Forensics of Desktop and Mobile Phone Applications

## Abstract

With the widespread adoption of desktop and mobile applications such as BankID, Discord, Steam, and Stremio, the need for comprehensive digital forensics becomes increasingly critical. These applications handle sensitive data, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals. This research aims to investigate forensic methodologies for extracting, analyzing, and preserving evidence from popular desktop and mobile applications, focusing on identifying potential security vulnerabilities and enhancing forensic capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The rise of desktop and mobile applications has transformed various aspects of modern life, including communication, entertainment, finance, and productivity. However, this convenience comes with significant cybersecurity risks, as these applications often store sensitive user information and are prime targets for cyber-attacks. Forensic analysis of these applications can provide valuable insights into security vulnerabilities, user behavior, and potential malicious activities.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

While significant advancements have been made in digital forensics, the rapidly evolving nature of desktop and mobile applications presents unique challenges. Current forensic tools and techniques may not fully address the complexities involved in analyzing modern applications. This research seeks to bridge this gap by developing and validating forensic methodologies tailored to popular applications such as BankID, Discord, Steam, and Stremio.
