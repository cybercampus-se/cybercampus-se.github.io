# Application Hacking

- **Thesis ID:** 24-06
- **Research Proposal:** Vulnerability Research of Mobile Applications Commonly Used in Sweden

## Abstract

The widespread use of mobile applications in everyday activities, such as banking, healthcare, public transportation, and scheduling, presents significant cybersecurity challenges. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of popular mobile applications used in Sweden, including BankID, Alltid öppet, SL, and Tempus. The study will identify potential security weaknesses, evaluate their impacts, and propose mitigation strategies to enhance the security of these applications and protect user data.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Mobile applications have become integral to daily life, providing convenience and functionality in various domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and personal organization. In Sweden, applications like BankID, Alltid öppet, SL, and Tempus are widely used, handling sensitive personal and financial information. The security of these applications is paramount to ensure user trust and protect against cyber threats.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite the benefits of mobile applications, they are often targeted by cybercriminals due to the sensitive data they handle. Existing security measures may not be sufficient to protect against sophisticated attacks, leading to potential data breaches and privacy violations. This research seeks to uncover vulnerabilities in commonly used Swedish mobile applications, assess their impact, and recommend security enhancements.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To identify and categorize potential vulnerabilities in mobile applications commonly used in Sweden.
2. To evaluate the impact of identified vulnerabilities on user security and privacy.
3. To propose mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities.
4. To contribute to the development of more secure mobile applications in Sweden.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Mobile Application Security

Overview of mobile application security, including common threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices for securing mobile apps.

### 2.2 Analysis of Popular Mobile Applications

Review of the specific applications to be studied (BankID, Alltid öppet, SL, Tempus), their functionalities, and their importance in the Swedish context.

### 2.3 Vulnerability Assessment Methodologies

Examination of methodologies and frameworks used in vulnerability assessment of mobile applications, including static and dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and threat modeling.

## 3. Research Methodology

### 3.1 Phase 1: Preliminary Analysis

1. **Application Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the selected applications (BankID, Alltid öppet, SL, Tempus) to understand their functionalities, architecture, and security mechanisms.
2. **Threat Modeling**: Development of threat models to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios for each application.

### 3.2 Phase 2: Vulnerability Identification

1. **Static Analysis**: Examination of the application codebases and configuration files for security flaws.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Monitoring the behavior of the applications under normal and abnormal conditions to identify security weaknesses.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Conducting ethical hacking attempts to exploit identified vulnerabilities, focusing on both remote and physical attack vectors.

### 3.3 Phase 3: Impact Evaluation

1. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the severity and potential impact of each identified vulnerability on user security and privacy.
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Simulating potential attack scenarios to understand the practical implications of the vulnerabilities.

### 3.4 Phase 4: Mitigation and Recommendations

1. **Mitigation Strategies**: Proposing technical solutions to address the identified vulnerabilities, including software patches, configuration changes, and improved security practices.
2. **Best Practices**: Developing a set of best practices for the development and deployment of secure mobile applications.

### 3.5 Phase 5: Validation and Testing

1. **Implementation of Mitigations**: Implementing the proposed solutions and testing their effectiveness.
2. **Re-evaluation**: Conducting a second round of vulnerability assessments to ensure the mitigations are effective and the applications are secure.

## 4. Expected Outcomes

1. **Comprehensive Vulnerability Report**: Detailed documentation of identified vulnerabilities, their impact, and potential mitigation strategies.
2. **Enhanced Security Protocols**: Development of improved security protocols and best practices for mobile application development and deployment.
3. **Academic Contributions**: Publication of findings in academic journals and conferences to contribute to the body of knowledge in mobile application security and cybersecurity.
