## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The growing reliance on digital systems necessitates the development of secure authentication methods. Traditional passwords are increasingly seen as inadequate due to their susceptibility to various attacks, including phishing, brute force, and credential stuffing. Biometric authentication, leveraging unique biological traits, offers a promising alternative. Offpad by PONE Biometrics is a state-of-the-art fingerprint-based authentication solution designed to provide secure, passwordless authentication. While it is FIDO-certified, ensuring a certain standard of security, it is imperative to subject such systems to rigorous vulnerability research to preemptively identify and mitigate potential security risks.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Despite the advantages of biometric authentication, these systems are not impervious to attacks. Vulnerabilities may exist in the biometric data processing, storage mechanisms, communication protocols, or the hardware itself. This research seeks to uncover such vulnerabilities within the Offpad device, assess their potential impact, and recommend solutions to enhance the security of this authentication method.

### 1.3 Objectives
1. To identify and categorize potential vulnerabilities in the Offpad fingerprint-based authentication solution.
2. To evaluate the impact of identified vulnerabilities on the overall security of the system.
3. To propose mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities.
4. To contribute to the development of more secure biometric authentication solutions.
