# LLM Air Gapped

- **Thesis ID:** 24-12
- **Research Proposal:** Building Air-Gapped Large Language Models (LLMs) for Sensitive Operations

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have become pivotal in various applications ranging from natural language processing to customer service automation. However, their deployment poses significant security risks, including data leaks, unauthorized access, and adversarial manipulation. This research proposes the development and evaluation of air-gapped LLMs as a robust security measure. By isolating LLMs from external networks, this study aims to mitigate security vulnerabilities, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected while maintaining the functionality and efficiency of the models.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, providing advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. These models are deployed across various industries, handling sensitive data and performing critical tasks. However, the interconnected nature of their deployment environments makes them susceptible to security breaches. Air-gapping, a security measure that involves isolating systems from external networks, offers a potential solution to these vulnerabilities.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The widespread use of LLMs in sensitive applications necessitates robust security measures to protect against data breaches, unauthorized access, and adversarial attacks.
