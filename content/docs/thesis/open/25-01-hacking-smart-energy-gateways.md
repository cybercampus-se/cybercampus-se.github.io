## 1. Background

The CheckWatt CM10 is a DIN rail-mounted gateway designed for metering and sensor data logging, facilitating automatic control through communication with CheckWatt cloud services via LAN and/or an internal 4G modem. It supports various communication protocols, including Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP, MQTT, and IEC 60870-5-103, and interfaces with devices such as energy meters, solar PV inverters, and temperature sensors. 

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite its advanced features, the CheckWatt CM10, like many IoT devices, may harbor vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors, potentially compromising energy data integrity and user privacy. This research seeks to systematically identify and assess these vulnerabilities to bolster the device's security.

  - Test for vulnerabilities such as lack of encryption or weak authentication mechanisms.

- **Exploitation**:
  - Develop and execute proof-of-concept exploits to demonstrate the impact of identified vulnerabilities.
  - Assess the potential consequences of exploitation, including unauthorized data access or device control.

- **Mitigation Recommendations**:
  - Based on findings, propose security enhancements to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
  - Suggest best practices for secure deployment and maintenance of the device.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
