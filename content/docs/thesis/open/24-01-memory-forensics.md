## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Memory forensics, or the analysis of a computer’s volatile memory (RAM) to extract digital artifacts, is a critical component of modern digital investigations. It allows cybersecurity professionals to detect and analyze malware, understand the behavior of adversaries, and recover evidence that may not be available on disk. With the release of Windows 11, significant changes in memory management, security features, and system architecture present new challenges and opportunities for memory forensics.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Windows 11 introduces several new features, such as improved virtualization-based security (VBS), memory integrity (Hypervisor-protected code integrity), and changes in memory allocation mechanisms. These changes may impact the ability of existing memory forensic tools to accurately capture and analyze memory data. This research seeks to identify the specific challenges posed by Windows 11 to memory forensics, evaluate the effectiveness of current tools, and develop enhanced techniques to address any identified gaps.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To analyze the impact of Windows 11’s new memory management and security features on memory forensics.
2. To evaluate the performance and accuracy of existing memory forensic tools when applied to Windows 11.
3. To develop and propose improved methodologies or tool modifications for effective memory forensics on Windows 11.
4. To contribute to the broader field of digital forensics by providing insights and practical solutions for investigators dealing with modern operating systems.
