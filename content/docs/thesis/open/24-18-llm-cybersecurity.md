## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, organizations are adopting advanced tools to detect, analyze, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing and problem-solving. However, their general-purpose nature limits their application in niche areas like cybersecurity, which demand a deep understanding of specialized data. By fine-tuning open-source LLMs with structured cybersecurity content, we can unlock their potential to assist cybersecurity professionals and researchers in handling complex tasks, such as analyzing vulnerabilities, generating mitigation strategies, and automating repetitive processes.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

While LLMs excel in processing general-purpose text, their effectiveness in specialized domains like cybersecurity remains limited without fine-tuning. Existing models often fail to understand technical terminologies, structured cybersecurity data (e.g., CWE and CVE), or the nuances of vulnerability assessments. Furthermore, there is little focus on how open-source platforms like HuggingFace can be leveraged to build domain-specific LLMs for cybersecurity applications.

### 1.3 Objectives

1. To fine-tune open-source LLMs using cybersecurity datasets, such as MITRE CWE and CVE, to enhance their domain expertise.
2. To leverage HuggingFace’s APIs, models, and libraries for efficient implementation and deployment.
3. To evaluate the fine-tuned model’s performance in tasks like vulnerability classification, threat identification, and mitigation suggestions.
4. To explore practical use cases, including educational tools, automated threat intelligence, and vulnerability triage.
5. To create a replicable pipeline for cybersecurity-specific model fine-tuning and deployment on platforms like HuggingFace.

   - Compare the fine-tuned model’s performance with the base model on cybersecurity-specific tasks.

2. **Benchmarking**:
   - Test the fine-tuned model against existing tools and systems for vulnerability analysis (e.g., static analysis tools).

3. **Practical Scenarios**:
   - Test the model in real-world scenarios, such as automated CVE triage or generating mitigation strategies for detected weaknesses.

### 3.4 Deployment and Integration

1. **API Development**:
   - Deploy the fine-tuned model on HuggingFace’s Inference API for easy accessibility and integration into existing workflows.
