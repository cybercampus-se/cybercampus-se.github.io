- **Thesis ID:** 24-09
- **Research Proposal:** Vulnerability Research of Large Language Models (LLMs): Discovering Vulnerabilities in GPTs and Their Plugins

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have transformed the landscape of natural language processing, providing powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their complexity and widespread use also present significant security challenges. This research aims to identify and analyze vulnerabilities in GPT models and their associated plugins. By examining potential exploits and security weaknesses, the study will provide insights into improving the security and robustness of these models and their extensions.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, performing complex language tasks, and integrating with various applications through plugins. Despite their utility, the extensive use of these models raises important cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in LLMs and their plugins could be exploited to manipulate outputs, gain unauthorized access, or compromise data integrity.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
