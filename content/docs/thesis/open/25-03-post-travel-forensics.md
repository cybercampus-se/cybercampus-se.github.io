# Post-Travel Device Forensics

## Abstract

When laptops, mobile phones, or other digital devices travel abroad—particularly across hostile jurisdictions or high-risk borders—they may be subjected to tampering, surveillance implants, or malware installation. Security researchers, journalists, diplomats, and business travelers face the risk of their devices being compromised through **border device searches, temporary confiscation, or covert manipulation**.

While security guidelines (e.g., “travel laptops” or “clean devices”) exist, there is a lack of standardized **post-travel forensic methodologies** to systematically evaluate whether a device has been altered after returning from abroad. Developing such a procedure is critical for protecting sensitive data, preventing supply chain infiltration, and improving digital security practices.

## 1. Research Problem

The main problem this project addresses is the absence of a reliable, replicable process to **examine devices post-travel** for signs of tampering—whether hardware (e.g., implants, altered firmware) or software (e.g., malware, persistence mechanisms).

## 2. Research Objectives

1. **Develop a forensic examination framework** tailored to devices that may have been exposed during international travel.
2. **Identify forensic indicators of tampering**, including hardware implants, OS-level modifications, persistence techniques, and network beaconing.
3. **Create a repeatable procedure** that organizations can adopt to verify the integrity of laptops, smartphones, and other portable devices after they return from abroad.
4. **Evaluate detection effectiveness** using simulated tampering scenarios in a controlled lab environment.

## 3. Methodology

* **Literature and Threat Landscape Review:** Survey known techniques for border device compromise (malware injection, bootloader tampering, firmware reflashing, hardware implants).
* **Testbed Setup:** Prepare laptops and smartphones with baseline forensic images.
* **Tampering Simulation:** Introduce controlled compromises (malware installation, altered configurations, hardware modifications) to simulate border attacks.
* **Forensic Analysis:** Apply memory forensics, file system analysis, boot/firmware integrity checks, and network monitoring to detect anomalies.
* **Procedure Development:** Formulate a step-by-step checklist and workflow for post-travel forensic inspection.
* **Evaluation:** Assess procedure effectiveness (detection rate, false positives/negatives) and feasibility (time, cost, required expertise).

## 4. Expected Contributions

* A **practical forensic procedure** for detecting tampering in devices after border crossings.
* Identification of **key forensic artifacts** and IoCs related to device compromise abroad.
* A **reference framework** organizations can adopt for journalists, businesses, and government entities.
* Recommendations for **future-proofing digital travel security practices**.

## 5. Tentative Timeline (6–9 Months)

1. **Months 1–2:** Literature review, threat modeling, testbed setup.
2. **Months 3–4:** Controlled tampering experiments, forensic imaging, data collection.
3. **Months 5–6:** Procedure development and refinement.
4. **Months 7–8:** Evaluation of detection capabilities, case studies.
5. **Month 9:** Final documentation and thesis writing.
