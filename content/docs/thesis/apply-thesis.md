## Preparing proposal

- Read the literature
- Select a few of studies to replicate
- Think of how to improve what you implemented
- Write your proposal

## Interviews

- Applications are not evaluated immediately upon receipt
- Evaluation begins when a sufficient number of applications for a particular thesis are collected
- The right candidate is then selected from the group of applicants
- Selected candidates are invited to interviews
- Interview dates are not set in advance
- Those selected for supervision are informed within two weeks of the interviews
- If we are unable to supervise you (e.g. if the quota is exceeded), we can inform you of possible supervisors
- You can then use your proposal to apply for another supervisor

## Publications

- Students who want to publish in a journal over others are prioritized
- Publications are submitted to the journals that we approve

## Recommendations

- Students are strongly encouraged to begin research on the interested topic at least 6 months before the expected start of the study.
- It is strongly recommended that students apply at least 3 months before the expected start of the study
- It is strongly recommended that students apply for job postings that they have **experience**
  - You are not expected to be an expert, but you are expected to be experienced
  - If you do not have experience, you can prepare yourself in a few months and then apply
  - For a vulnerability research study (i.e., IoT hacking) you need to have experience hacking an IoT device
  - For an LLM security study (i.e., Hacking with LLM) you need to have experience data sanitization (reducing token counts), fine tuning, LangChain, LangGraph, LLM assistant APIs, etc.
- Students should complete the preliminary work before the thesis work begins
  - **IMPORTANT:** The proposal must include the preliminary work, for example
  - For a vulnerability research studies (i.e., ethical hacking) you need to include a complete threat model or attacks that will be performed
  - For other studies the data should be collected
- The work you perform in our lab must be of a quality that can be published in a journal
- You are expected to spend at least 20 hours per week on this work during the study period. However, based on our experience, we recommend that you devote your full focus and time entirely to your thesis work.

## Opportunities

- Some students are offered to have a seat in our laboratory
  - Students are selected based on various criteria (full-time study or publication desire)
- Working in the lab provides a unique mentoring service
