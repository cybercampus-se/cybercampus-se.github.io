## Interviews

- Applications are not evaluated immediately upon receipt
- Evaluation begins when a sufficient number of applications for a particular thesis are collected
- The right candidate is then selected from the group of applicants
- Selected candidates are invited to interviews
- Interview dates are not set in advance
- Those selected for supervision are informed within two weeks of the interviews
- If we are unable to supervise you (e.g. if the quota is exceeded), we can inform you of possible supervisors
- You can then use your proposal to apply for another supervisor

## Opportunities

- Some students are offered to have seats in our laboratory during the study
  - Selection is based on various criteria (full-time study or publication desire)
