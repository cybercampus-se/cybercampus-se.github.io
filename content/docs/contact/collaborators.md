- In addition, we distribute job opening of the company in our e-mail groups and circle.
  - Collaborators can post job openings on our website
  - Collaborators are also advertised as collaborators on our page

## Responsibilities

- The collaborator bears no financial responsibility during the thesis research. 

## Funding

- The funding we receive in exchange for our research helps us keep our laboratory running. You can contribute financing to our laboratory based on the scope of the research to be conducted for you.
  - We can perform master thesis study as a paid work (a good incentive to produce better results)
- We are also eager to conduct long-term studies (5 years) with companies, either by locating a researcher in our lab or on your side.
