# About Us

## Our History

Hacking Lab was founded and sponsored by [Pontus Johnson](https://www.kth.se/profile/pontusj) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2020. The lab was established to facilitate doctoral and postdoctoral research within the [NSE division](https://www.kth.se/cs/nse/research/software-systems-architecture-and-security/projects/ethical-hacking-1.1279219). Over time, we acquired numerous IoT devices, providing master's students with hands-on experience in ethical hacking for their theses.

We were based at Teknikringen 33, then Hacking Lab joined Cybercampus Sverige in early 2024 and relocated to Valhallavägen 79. To honor our origins, we rebranded as Royal Hacking Lab right after joining. Since then, Hacking Lab has been made available to all Swedish Universities. 

## Current

[Emre Süren](https://people.kth.se/~emsuren/?CC) served as a postdoctoral researcher at NSE division from 2020 to 2023, dedicating much of his time in the Hacking Lab to hacking IoT devices and developing an IoT hacking methodology. After completing his postdoctoral work, he transitioned to a researcher role at Cybercampus Sverige, where he is responsible for leading research activities at the Royal Hacking Lab as well as managing the lab infrastructure.
