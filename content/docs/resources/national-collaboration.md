# National Collaboration

Cybercampus Sweden has initiated a national research infrastructure collaboration between partnering universities. The background to this initiative is to simplify the process of finding relevant infrastructure when conducting research, and to better understand the potential of each connected university and in turn, Swedish research infrastructure as a whole. 

This project is still under development, which means that its contents, rules and requirements are subject to change. As of right now, we offer a kind of library of available resources that can also be found by anyone on the internet, where the rules of each connected university lab still apply. If you wish to rent, borrow or use resources from a lab, please follow their respective rules on their own website, or contact the relevant lab manager for more information.
