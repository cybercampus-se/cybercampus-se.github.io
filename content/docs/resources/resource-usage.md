# Resource Usage

## Receiving Procedure

- Once you submit your application, it will be reviewed
- If your application is not a good fit, you will be contacted
- Once your resources are prepared, you will receive an email stating where and when you can access them

## Shared Resource

- It is vital to respect that the resources provided to you (e.g. hacking tools and devices) are **shared**
- If two or more students need to use the same resource, it is their shared responsibility to sync and share devices

## Return Procedure

- You bare the responsibility to return the items you have borrowed when you are done with them
- To ensure the correct storage and return of devices from our lab, we require the following steps to be carried out by the borrower before returning the devices:
  - Ensure that all the devices are included in the box along with the charger and any other accessories that were provided.
  - Remove any personal data from the devices and restore them to factory settings.
  - If any external apps were used to perform a study on the devices, such as a smart controller app for iOS and Android, including especially those which require the registration of the device with an account, ensure that the device is unregistered from the account and that the account is deleted.
  - Charge all devices to an adequate level before returning them to the Lab (it is recommended for storage, if possible, to have devices stored with no more than 50% of their battery capacity).
  - Check for any physical damage or issues with the devices, such as cracks, or malfunctions, and report them if found and affecting the functions of the device. As well as report if any hardware physical studies have been carried out on the devices.
  - Ensure that the box is properly closed.
